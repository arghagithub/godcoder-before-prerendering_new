        <h3>Who is a coder ?</h3>
        <p>"Coder" is not a person, but rather a term that refers to someone who writes or develops software code. However, the term can also refer to the open-source, cloud-based development environment that allows developers to write, test, and run their code in a web browser, as I explained in my previous answer.</p>
        <h3>Responsibilities of coder</h3>
        <p> the responsibility of a coder is to write high-quality code that meets the needs of the project they are working on, while also adhering to industry standards and ensuring the security and privacy of users.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Writing high-quality code</li>
          <li>Testing and debugging</li>
